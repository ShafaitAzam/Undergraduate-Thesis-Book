## Introduction

My thesis topic was Computational Optimization with Deep Neural Network and Clustering algorithms. I have designed a deep neural network and combined it with unsupervised learning algorithms (K-Mean, Fuzzy C-Mean) using MATLAB. I have trained my model with three benchmark datasets (Breast Cancer, Diabetes and Heart Attack). The model could predict the possibility of having Breast Cancer, Diabetes and Heart Attack with higher accuracy. I have also illustrated the comparison between different types of clustering algorithms
